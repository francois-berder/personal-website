Hello!

I am Francois Berder, a software engineer based in France.

I moved to the UK in 2009 and started studying computer science at Imperial College London two years later. I graduated in 2015 and started a career working on embedded systems, first at Imagination Technologies, then in a small company in Cambridge.

I have been back in Paris, France since May 2021, working as a freelancer.

I have always been passionate about modelism and built numerous 1/48 aircraft scale models over the past 15 years. I have also built two remote-controlled boats and I am currently working at the moment on a remote-controlled submarine.
Along with modelism, I have a keen interest in electronics, gradually improving my skills to reach a professional level. I enjoy designing custom boards on Kicad that I can put to use in a remote-control scale model.
